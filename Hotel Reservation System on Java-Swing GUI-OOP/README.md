# Description 
OOP Project made in Java Swing GUI library using Netbeans. This system provides room booking service to customers where hotel staff can view the current details about an occupied room, add amenities to a current booking, as well as post available rooms in the system as they are vacated. Meanwhile customers can view the information about a particular room and book them accordingly. The system is hence useful for both customers and managers to conveniently manage the hotel activities.
