# Numerical Analysis Assignments 

This repository contains code for different methods mentioned in numerical computing. Interpolation of polynomials and root-finding problems are covered here including:
- Bisection Method
- Fixed Point Method
- Newton Method
- Lagrange Polynomial 
- Divided Difference 
- Trapozoidal Rule
- Simpson's Rule

Python is used here along with popular libraries including: Matplotlib, Scipy, Sympi, Numpy and tabulate. Filing was a requirement, so that is why the code will also generate output in .txt file as well as plotted graphs.
